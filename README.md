Remote File Syncing Client Linux

Currently Working withe only connection Making with Dropbox through Core API. Make sure you have App_key and AP_Secure
as well as a developer account with Dorp box. Its free to register initially if you have a dropbox account. 

More Iteration with Much more Integration with various cloud storages comming in future.

The Tool/Client Application is intended to be Open Source under GPLv3 License and cross paltform but the main focus is to 
have a linux based multiple cloud storage client as its something missing found these days.
